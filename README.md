[中文](README_CN.md) | [English](README.md) | [Claude Code Architecture Deep Dive (7 articles)](article/)

**512,000 lines of TypeScript → ~1,400 lines of Python.**

I spent two days reverse-engineering the leaked Claude Code source — all half a million lines. Then I stripped it down to the load-bearing walls and rebuilt them in Python. The result: **every key architectural pattern from Claude Code, in a codebase you can read in one sitting.**

CoreCoder is not another AI coding tool. It's a **blueprint** — the [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) of coding agents. Read it, fork it, build your own.

## What You Get

Claude Code's 512K lines distilled into ~1,400 lines across 7 patterns that actually matter:

| Pattern | Claude Code | CoreCoder |
|---|---|---|
| Search-and-replace editing (unique match + diff) | FileEditTool | `tools/edit.py` — 70 lines |
| Parallel tool execution | StreamingToolExecutor (530 lines) | `agent.py` — ThreadPool |
| 3-layer context compression | HISTORY_SNIP → Microcompact → CONTEXT_COLLAPSE | `context.py` — 145 lines |
| Sub-agent with isolated context | AgentTool (1,397 lines) | `tools/agent.py` — 50 lines |
| Dangerous command blocking | BashTool (1,143 lines) | `tools/bash.py` — 95 lines |
| Session persistence | QueryEngine (1,295 lines) | `session.py` — 65 lines |
| Dynamic system prompt | prompts.ts (914 lines) | `prompt.py` — 35 lines |

Every pattern is a real, runnable implementation — not a diagram or a blog post.

## Install

```bash
pip install corecoder
```

Pick your model — any OpenAI-compatible API works. You can `export` env vars or drop a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Kimi K2.5
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.moonshot.ai/v1
corecoder -m kimi-k2.5

# Claude Opus 4.6 (via OpenRouter)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
corecoder -m anthropic/claude-opus-4-6

# OpenAI GPT-5
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
corecoder -m gpt-5

# DeepSeek V3
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
corecoder -m deepseek-chat

# Qwen 3.5
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
corecoder -m qwen-max

# Ollama (local)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
corecoder -m qwen3:32b

# One-shot mode
corecoder -p "add error handling to parse_config()"
```

### Non-OpenAI providers (Bedrock, Vertex, Cohere, …)

For providers without an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, install the optional LiteLLM extra:

```bash
pip install 'corecoder[litellm]'

export CORECODER_PROVIDER=litellm
export CORECODER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku   # any LiteLLM model string
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
corecoder
```

LiteLLM routes through to 100+ providers (Bedrock, Vertex AI, Cohere, Groq, Replicate, Anyscale, etc.) using one model-string convention. The default `openai` backend is unchanged.

### Telegram Remote Control (Experimental)

If you want to control CoreCoder from your phone, install the optional Telegram extra:

```bash
pip install 'corecoder[telegram]'

export CORECODER_MODEL=gpt-5
export CORECODER_API_KEY=sk-...
export CORECODER_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:telegram-token
export CORECODER_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS=123456789
corecoder-telegram
```

The Telegram adapter is intentionally minimal and reuses the existing task runtime:

- send any text to start or continue a coding task
- `/task` shows the current task state
- `/trace` shows the latest trace summary
- `/approve` / `/reject` resolve pending approvals
- `/approve-all` resolves the current approval and auto-approves later normal confirms for the same task
- `/resume <task_id>` restores a saved checkpoint into the chat

This follows the same channel-adapter idea used by projects like `claw0`, but keeps CoreCoder single-channel and lightweight instead of growing into a full gateway.

## Architecture

The whole thing fits in your head:

```

```

## Use as a Library

```python
from corecoder import Agent, LLM

llm = LLM(model="kimi-k2.5", api_key="your-key", base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1")
agent = Agent(llm=llm)
response = agent.chat("find all TODO comments in this project and list them")
```

## Add Your Own Tools (~20 lines)

```python
from corecoder.tools.base import Tool

class HttpTool(Tool):
    name = "http"
    description = "Fetch a URL."
    parameters = {"type": "object", "properties": {"url": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["url"]}

    def execute(self, url: str) -> str:
        import urllib.request
        return urllib.request.urlopen(url).read().decode()[:5000]
```

## Commands

```
/model           Show current model
/model <name>    Switch model mid-conversation
/compact         Compress context (like Claude Code's /compact)
/tokens          Token usage + cost estimate
/diff            Show files modified this session
/save            Save session to disk
/sessions        List saved sessions
/reset           Clear history
quit             Exit
```

Saved session IDs are sanitized before they become filenames, so resume data stays inside `~/.corecoder/sessions`.

Telegram commands:

```
/start           Show Telegram help
/task            Show current task state
/tasks           List recent checkpoints
/trace           Show trace for the current task
/approve         Approve the pending tool call
/approve-all     Approve this tool call and auto-approve later normal confirms
/reject          Reject the pending tool call
/resume <id>     Resume a saved task checkpoint into this chat
/reset           Clear the in-memory chat session
```

## The Deep Dive

I wrote [7 articles](article/) breaking down Claude Code's architecture — the agent loop, tool system, context compression, streaming executor, multi-agent, and 44 hidden feature flags. If you want to understand *why* CoreCoder is designed this way, start there.

## FAQ

**Does CoreCoder support Skills / Subagents / MCP?**

No, and that's intentional. CoreCoder is the minimal runnable core — agent loop, tools, streaming, compaction. Skills, Subagents, MCP, hooks, and plugins are upper-layer features that Claude Code layers on top; if CoreCoder had them too it would stop being a teaching artifact. The architecture articles above cover how those systems work in Claude Code, so you can add them yourself if you need to.

If you want Skills specifically, the recipe is small: scan `~/.claude/skills/*.md` at startup, list their titles in the system prompt, and let the agent ask for a skill by name before you inline that file's body into the conversation.
