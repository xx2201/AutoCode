"""Sub-agent spawning (inspired by Claude Code's AgentTool, 1397 lines).

The idea: for complex sub-tasks, spawn an independent agent with its own
conversation history and tool access. This lets the main agent delegate
work like "go research this codebase and report back" without polluting
its own context window.

The sub-agent runs to completion and returns a text summary.
